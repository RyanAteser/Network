INSTRUCTIONS:

Systems we need to setup to get this running-
    FortiGate 40f local host -
    SecureCRT SSH - 
    VPN - 



Heres What you need to do for the Script-
    Make Sure you change The Text File that you copy all your ip addresses into. For example, In my code i have this line of code  with open
    """"""
    (r'Network-\ip_address.txt', 'r') as file:
    """"""
    A Easy way to do this is in the folder provided, you will see ip_address.txt, Right click and Copy path and paste it into the quotations.
    You may also want to do this to outputFORTIOS.txt as well.
    Once you have that completed OPEN up all your systems and make sure they are working. OPEN up SecureCRT and 
    above where it says File - Edit etc. Go to
    Scripts - Run; Locate File and Run it!
    MAKE SURE YOU POPULATE THE TEXTFILE WITH YOUR IPs

    Also If you ever want to mess around and play with it and need a bunch of randomIPs. Just run the randomIP.py and it will populate the txt file for you.
